## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on the eccomerce website and fully completed and implemented the navbar. Tomorrow, I hope on making the frontpage and making a cool design and some animations.

I also created an arduino binary counter using 2 buttons and 3 LEDs. It was super fun and was actually challenging as I had to make sure I accounted for the button debounce. Got it working seamlessly and I would say the wiring was really neat, nice, and efficient.

## Learnings

- Connecting buttons to a breadboard.
- Conditional styling in tailwind.
- Dynamic styling/sizing in tailwind.

## Goals

1. Continue working on eccomerce site.
2. Make personal website blogs hosted on 3rd-party website and fetch them to display.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
if (leftButtonState == leftButtonState2) {
  // If you have 2 consistent readings.
  if (leftButtonState != decreaseState) {
    // If button state changed.
    if (leftButtonState == HIGH) {
      // If button pressed.
      if (binaryCount > 0) {
        // Decrease count if within range.
        binaryCount--;
      }
    }
  }
  // Save button state for next loop.
  decreaseState = leftButtonState;
}
```

Cool solution of dealing with button debounce. The timing and state saving was handled in code beforehand.
