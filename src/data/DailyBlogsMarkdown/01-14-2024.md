## Coding Summary

Today, I finally completely finished the Post-Plant replay system. It was challenging to get everything to be synced up and with the useState variables to be appropriately updated in order to keep the round and time synced up. Overall, I am almost done with the website. I have a few more style changes/fixes along with some features (like better agent overviews) in order to complete the website.

## Learnings

- Solidified my knowledge of useEffect().
  - Super useful with using multiple useEffects with different dependencies.
- find() vs filter() in javascript.
  - find() returns object/reference, filter() returns array.

## Goals

1. Make Post-Plant competitive portal.
   1. Competitive stats, replays, and heatmaps.
2. Learn Next-UI.
3. HLTV Top 20.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
const name =
  name.length > maxLength ? name.substring(0, maxLength) + "..." : name;

return <p>{name}</p>;
```

Cool little way to shorten names if they are too long to fit in a component.

## Other

Have to do more research on [TreasuryDirect's](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) API. I want to make sure the business idea is possible and that we can maximize the amount of data we can collect to show to users. Hopefully we can make something work!
