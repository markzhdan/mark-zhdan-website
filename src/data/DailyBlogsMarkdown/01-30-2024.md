## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on planning and managing the entire project for Curriculo (QuickNote). I focused on creating the GitHub Org, and I also set up the repo and project structure. I also created an org task board which has custom statuses, priorities, sizes.

I am super excited for this new project. We introduced another team member who is very knowledgable with the architecture, scaling, and machine learning. We have some really fun and interesting ideas that will be fun to implement.

## Learnings

- GitHub Organizations.
  - Projects.
  - Repos.
- OpenAI API & Google Gemini API.
- Next.js & FastAPI templates/boilderplate.

## Goals

1. Figure out Curriculo UX layout.
   1. Figure out what data we need for users.
2. Continue working on eccomerce site.
3. Make personal website blogs hosted on 3rd-party website and fetch them to display.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-pro");
text = extract_text_from_pdf("./sample_pdfs/math210.pdf");
assignment_prompt = "...";
response = model.generate_content(text + assignment_prompt);
```

Code to prompt Google Gemini for a result. This is used to parse PDFs/syllabi to retrieve important course information.
