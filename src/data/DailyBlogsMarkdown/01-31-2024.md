## Coding Summary

Today, I continued working on Curriculo. I first looked at the Blackboard API and its documentation. I am fairly certain you can use it as an SSO login and then get the student's course information from the API. This would be super beneficial as uploading syllabi would be seamless and automatic. I applied for the API and created an email for the website.

I also worked on the UX by creating a sitemap and figuring out user flow. It was a struggle to figure out FlowMapp and Figma and I just scratched the surface of it.

## Learnings

- FlowMapp.
- Figma.
- Explore Blackboard's API.

## Goals

1. Figure out Curriculo UX layout.
   1. Figure out what data we need for users.
2. Create sidebar nav for Curriculo.
