## Coding Summary

Today, I used my TypeScript knowledge to explore to create-react-app TS template and tried to get myself familiar with it. It's not too different and it basically is the same thing put seems much better since everything is typed and predictable. Still a challenge to type props and implementations. I also worked on the treasuryUI extension but I didn't get as much done as I hoped to since I was trying to fix the bug where the page would load and flicker before my UI replaced it. Still not perfect but I got it to look much better and got the navigation hooked up for each page.

## Learnings

- TypeScript enums, typing, interface, implements.
- Chrome extensions and build util files.
- Next.JS quick overview.

## Goals

1. Learn Next.js using [course.](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)
1. Finish template of TreasuryUI exetnsion.
1. Create Post-Plant Teams page layouts/content guide.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
interface SolarEclipse {
  [latitude: string]: boolean;
}
```

This is EXACTLY what I need for my Buff163 API Wrapper where the item id occurs in the return json. I need to figure out the python equivalent for this.
