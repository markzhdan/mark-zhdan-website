## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on fully implementing the replay feature at Post-Plant. I fixed a lot of bugs like the time restarting, rounds not switching, round 1 not being accessible, and a lot more. Now, all I have to do is the add VOD and start time setter and the replay feature should be all complete!

## Learnings

- React routes.
- Cool website: [theresanaiforthat](https://theresanaiforthat.com/)
  - Finds if an AI exists for a specific top.

## Goals

1. Learn Next-UI.
2. Polish up replay feature.
3. HLTV Top 20.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
<Route path="/match/:matchId" element={<Match />}>
    <Route index element={<Navigate replace to="scoreboard" />} />
    <Route path="scoreboard" element={<ScoreboardTab />} />
    <Route path="replay" element={<ReplayTab />} />
</Route>

<Outlet />
```

The way to have children rendered depending on the url route.

## Other

I was researching different AI note taking/summarizing websites that turn notes into quizzes/study methods. It was a pretty common idea that has been replicated multiple times now. I don't think I'll follow up with the idea and make a full blown website now.

Time for some more brainstorming...
