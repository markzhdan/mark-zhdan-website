## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on the Buff163 API. I added category enums and another function for getting a specific item's market page. I did not do much today as I would have hoped to as I'm getting ready to go back to college this next week.

## Learnings

- Learned that making API wrappers isn't about coding but about the research of the API and making syntax easy to write.
  - It's more about the "dirty work" of making dict classes and enum types.

## Goals

1. Adding item functions to Buff163 API.
2. Apply to internships.
3. HLTV top 20 players of 2023.
4. Post-Plant replay feature.

## Cool Snippet

```python
def get_item(category: Union[Knife, Gun, Glove, Agent, Sticker, OtherItem])

api.get_item(category=Gun.AK47)
```

Pretty cool how enums allow for "automatic" type hinting. Always wondered how libraries did this.

## Other

Hopefully I can keep up this challenge. I feel like I am losing a little bit of steam. I already got most of the projects I wanted to do started and now it is just keeping them updated and adding features. While its fun, I think I like building out features and websites from the beginning more.
