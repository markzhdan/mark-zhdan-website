## Coding Summary

Today was a very big day for Curriculo. We met with the other team members and had a very productive discussion of how the data flow and pricing will look. At first we wanted to embed the LLM responses and store them in a vector database for future prompt contextualization. However, with how pricing worked of the vector database, it would cost \$330 per user... Yeah, not the best having to charge \$500 per month haha.

However, I think now we are leaning into storing output and just using output as context for the prompts. We are also restructuring from vectorizing to simply json as we realized that the LLM models already have the entire contextualization of the courses/data/topics and we just need to provide the relevent course.

## Learnings

- Cloud hosting / database hosting costs.
- LLM output (yaml vs. json).
- [LLM seeding.](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/openai-seeding-model-fingerprints-log-probabilities-cedf094e8b02)
- I have to read [this.](https://olickel.com/everything-i-know-about-prompting-llms#understandingcomplexity)

## Goals

1. Add backend to personal website.
2. Figure out data flow for Curriculo.

## Other

I also applied to a bunch more internships today. The Simplify extension is super nice when autofilling out the applications!

Also, after looking at cloud costs, now I know why Microsoft is valued at 1 trillion.
