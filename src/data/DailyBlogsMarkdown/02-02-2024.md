## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on trying to update my personal website blogs by adding a CMS. I looked at multiple methods like Strapi and Sanity but I wasn't able to fully understand how to integrate them. I think in the end I will go with netlify CMS and also transition my hosting provider to netlify.

I also started "relearning" nextjs and just reinforced some of my knowledge and differences with react.

## Learnings

- CMS Systems.
- Github CMS?

## Goals

1. Figure out Curriculo UX layout.
   1. Figure out what data we need for users.
2. Add netlify CMS to personal website.

## Other

Today is also a big day as I changed my Google account pfp for markzhdan@gmail.com for the first time in 8 years! I just felt like I needed a change and I hope this could be a milestone for my new pfp of my baby picture as I pushed my stroller. Onto the next 8 years!
