## Coding Summary

I worked on creating a unofficial Buff163 API python wrapper. I've wanted to do this for a long time now and it was rewarding to get major progress completed. I wrote the rest_adapter and all the base code. All that is left is to implement all the API route features (like getSkinPrice, etc.).

Inspired by [Pretzel](https://www.pretzellogix.net/2021/12/08/how-to-write-a-python3-sdk-library-module-for-a-json-rest-api/)

## Learnings

- Learned to create and abstract an API.
- Uploaded my first python package to pip (PyPI).
- Created automatic docs on ReadTheDocs.
- Cleaned up Linkedin.

## Goals

1. Update website to include daily blogs.
2. Update frontpage of Post-Plant

## Cool Snippet

```python
market = buff163api.get_featured_market()
```

First API wrapper function! Exciting to start getting more functions going as it will then be easier to create market bots/price analyzers.
