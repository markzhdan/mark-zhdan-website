## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on creating a PRD and business plan for QuickNote which is a tool to help college students get organized in their classes. It's a website that will use OpenAI's API to parse lecture notes for quick notes and key concepts, curate a schedule of assignments and exams from the syllabus, and offer quizzes/practice exams based on lecture content.

## Learnings

- OpenAI API.
  - Pricing, how to use and integrate.

## Goals

1. Figure out QuickNote page/UX layout.
2. Continue working on eccomerce site.
3. Make personal website blogs hosted on 3rd-party website and fetch them to display.
