## Coding Summary

Today I wrapped up a lot of loose ends and did a lot of homework. This sets me up well for this weekend's hackathon and I am super excited to develop a cool app in 24 hours.

I also worked on Curriculo and tidied up the project and file structure of the Research repo. I learned how to encrypt the prompts to make sure its secure and no one can hack and steal our valuable prompts.

## Learnings

- Cryptomator.
- How encrypting/decrypting works.

## Goals

1. Add backend to personal website.
2. Figure out data flow for Curriculo.
