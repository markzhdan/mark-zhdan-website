## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on updating and adding the Post-Plant replay feature. Overall, it was challenging as I had to restructure the page views to make the api call/useEffect call between the scoreboard and replay tab.

## Learnings

- Learned about OpenAI/ChatGPT API.
- Query params (?view=replay).
- useMemo to cache calculations across renders.

## Goals

1. Create notes app notion overview.
2. Learn Next-UI.
3. Polish up replay feature.
4. HLTV Top 20.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
const viewParam = searchParams.get("view");
```

A simple example of query params.

## Other

I have some ideas for new website ideas! One is an NBA game prediction site and another with more promise is an AI to automatically parse your lecture notes (either student or prof notes) and then make simplified notes/quizzes/definitions for each lecture. Before an exam in the class, you can go through your notes or take a quiz about your notes/content to prepare you.

I also finally fully understand how a backend and frontend communicate/work together. I want to learn how make a backend in python hopefully!
