## Coding Summary

Today, was not as productive programming wise but I got a lot of stuff done. Moved back to UIC to start my 2nd semester! I also applied to 12 internships and one of them Matroid had a very fun challenge at the end to expedite the resume! Without giving away too much, a url was encoded and there were some fun functions in the html/source. I think I have a pretty good shot for the full-stack position!

## Learnings

- Learned about calling code from the console.
- DNS zones.
- [Cool video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_WFZTIxDW4) about local storage
  - Will migrate from local storage to cookies to store my jwt tokens on Post-Plant

## Goals

1. Go through class syllabi and get notion calendar populated for semester.
2. Adding item functions to Buff163 API.
3. HLTV top 20 players of 2023.
4. Post-Plant replay feature.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
document.getElementById("a-link").removeAttribute("disable");
var Clickevent = new MouseEvent("dblclick", { view: window });
document.getElementById("a-link").dispatchEvent(Clickevent);
```

Interesting that you can alter some of the elements in order to run some code that otherwise you couldn't.
