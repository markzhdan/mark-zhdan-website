## Coding Summary

Today, I learned TypeScript through CodeAcademy and I am about 80% complete with the course. Seems like a solid way to typing JS and making sure everything works smoothly. I also continued development of the TreasuryReport UI extensions and restarted using this [boilerplate](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react). I'm actually excited for it now because using React will speed up the design process 50x since I won't have a giant html and css file. I completely the sidebar today and will work on scraping the data and then displaying it on the content.

## Learnings

- Completed TS Course @ [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-typescript/lessons/typescript-functions/exercises/introduction).
- Learned how to use a boilerplate from GitHub (with clone).
- Quick overview about Tailwind, what it's used for, how to use it and some sample styling.

## Goals

1. Figure out TreasuryDirect navigation, page views, links, and how to scrape data.
2. Create Post-Plant teams notion overview (PRD, timeline, tech stack).
   - Learn Next.js by weekend.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
<a class="relative flex items-center w-full h-12 px-3 mt-2 rounded hover:bg-gray-300">
  <Icon />
  <span class="absolute top-0 left-0 w-2 h-2 mt-2 ml-2 bg-td-main rounded-full"></span>
</a>
};
```

A pretty awesome way to style and seems super efficient. Instead of copy pasting, I had to write out the code snippet and it was really quick and easy to type out. Can't image how much fast writing styling will be if I fully learn it.

I can't imagine I said that in my last blog about Tailwind... haha
