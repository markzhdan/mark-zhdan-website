## Coding Summary

Today was my first day back at UIC! Monday is my busiest day and I am pretty much in class from 9-6. However, one of my classes didn't have lab and I found the chance to update and write my blog about reverse engineering vlr.gg's rating. Looking back, the formula was incorrect and didn't take into account the correct metrics. I focused on updating it and also wrote the full detailed blog post!

I also added Google Analytics to this site to track users and fixed up some positioning/styling bugs.

## Learnings

- Learned how to implement Google Analytics into websites.

## Goals

1. Populate Notion calendar.
2. Post-Plant replay feature.
3. Adding item functions to Buff163 API.
4. HLTV top 20 players of 2023.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
# Calculate ADRa
if "ADR" in df.columns and "Rnd" in df.columns and "K" in df.columns:
    totalDamage = df["ADR"] * df["Rnd"]
    damagePerKill = 140 * df["K"]
    ADRa = (totalDamage - damagePerKill) / df["Rnd"]
    df["ADRa"] = round(ADRa, 3)
```

Pretty cool way of calculating "true" ADR to make it a completely independent metric which doesn't implement KPR.
