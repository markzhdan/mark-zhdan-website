## Coding Summary

Today, was not a productive day at all. Did not do much as I had a lot of homework for the upcoming week, but I did spend some time on my data structures project and also worked on the eccomerce website a little bit more.

I want to completely change this personal website blog style to have it host and pull the blogs from a different source so it doesn't count as a commit. I realized that I am focusing too much on GitHub commits and not learning anything at all. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868) really inspired me and showed how I can do so much more and much more meaninful commits and actually start contributing useful and fun projects!

## Learnings

- Falling sand simulation.
- Vingere cipher.

## Goals

1. Continue working on eccomerce site.
2. Create Post-Plant Teams page layouts/content guide.
   - Figure out the automatic game start finder.
3. Clean up Post-Plant UI.

## Other

We had this really smart and cool idea to make an app for laundry machines at our dorm. It would pretty much let you know the capacity and if any machines are available from your phone so you don't have to go down and check. Would need a lot of work and still deciding on how we would detect them, but its a super cool idea.
