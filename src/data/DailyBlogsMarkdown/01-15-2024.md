## Coding Summary

Today, I started work on a Chrome extension to change the UI of TreasuryDirect.gov. I was brainstorming with my brother about a possibility of streamlining the user experience for the site and making it easier to manage your govt. bonds. Since there is no API and I don't think you're allowed to trade outside of the secure site, our best solution was to build an overlay for the site and maybe scrape the data and use it for our own site.

## Learnings

- How to create a basic Chrome extension.
- Researched different APIs.
- Learned how to make a business PRD.

## Goals

1. Update TreasuryReport extension.
2. Make Post-Plant competitive portal.
   - Competitive stats, replays, and heatmaps.
3. HLTV Top 20 Predictions.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
const contentDiv = document.querySelector("#content");
if (contentDiv) {
  contentDiv.innerHTML = `
    <h1>Treasury Report</h1>
    <button>View Holdings</button>
    <h2>Your Securities Total: ${securitiesTotal}</h2>
    `;
}
```

Pretty cool way of injecting your own HTML and stylings using a chrome extension.

## Other

This TreasuryReport project will be interesting because there are no API calls being made from the frontend for content. It is all done through server-side rendering of HTML content delivery. I have to do more research on if its possible to make a wrapper for calls or if you can even access the site with user credentials.
