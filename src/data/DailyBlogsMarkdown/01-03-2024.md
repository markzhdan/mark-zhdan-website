## Coding Summary

I spent the day cleaning up and adding blogs to my personal website (the one you're on right now). Updated folder and file structure to support navigation/routes and added blogs.

## Learnings

- How to use MUI componenets (calendar).
- How good React code is written with reusable components (links).
  - Still have a lot to improve on...
- That I can't import .md files.

## Goals

1. Update frontpage of Post-Plant.
2. Start prediction of HLTV top 20 players of 2023.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
const pageElements = document.getElementsByClassName("Page");
```

Not sure if using this within React is good practice, but it was the easiest solution for positioning the content.
