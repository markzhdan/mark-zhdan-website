## Coding Summary

Today, focused on Post-Plant and did maintaince work to get me ready to add the replay system. I really need to completely overhaul the frontend and I know if I re-do it, I can make it much better with a UI library like MUI. However, it is simply not worth it with school starting and other priorities. This is some good practice if I were to become a project lead which would prepare me to correctly prioritize tasks.

## Tasks Completed

- [x] Updated content box sizes to fit content.
  - [x] Dashboard: rank history, winrate.
- [x] Sorted match list array when parsing.
- [x] Updated rank history to do total elo, not rank elo.
- [x] Added replay parsing to match parsing.
- [x] Aligned scoreboard.
  - [x] Spacing, max length.

## Goals

1. Post-Plant replay feature.
2. HLTV top 20 players of 2023.
3. Adding item functions to Buff163 API.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
const loadImage = (src) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const image = new Image();
    image.onload = () => resolve(image);
    image.src = src;
  });
};
```

Did not know you need to load images like this for chart.js. Is this the most efficient way?!?

## Other

I want to work on a website with someone / on a team. I met this guy in my class who has experience with the backend! Would be fun to create a project together. I have to brainstorm ideas but I want to make an actual business with value that generates $.
