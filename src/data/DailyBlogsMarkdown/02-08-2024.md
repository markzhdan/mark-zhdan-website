## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on Curriculo and we finally figured out the features for the first MVP and also came up with a good roadmap of how to implement it and the database providers we will use. We still have some things we have to iron out but I am confident that the next few weeks will be productive.

Excited for the hackathon tomorrow! I figured out the boilerplate for the project and we will use React with tailwind just for the NextUI components. Speaking of NextUI I think I will buy their recently released pro version but it does cost $150 which is a tough fee to pay right now.

## Learnings

- Tailwind with React.
- NextUI components and exploration of styling.

## Goals

1. Add backend to personal website.
2. Figure out data flow for Curriculo.

## Other

I heard back from a few internships today! Some rejections but I also got another survey/form to fill out which is a good sign? Only time will tell...
