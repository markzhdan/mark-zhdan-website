## Coding Summary

Today, I took notes on the differences of Next.js and React structure. I just outlined the main topics/features of Next.js and wrote them down so I can easily remember them and have a quick reference if I get lost.

I also started developing a new practice site to continue learning Next.js. I plan to make a quick eccomerce site that my sister could possibily use. I made the boilerplate code, explored the files, and explored some tailwind classes to make myself familiar with styling.

## Learnings

- Converting NFAs to DFAs.

## Goals

1. Create eccomerce site.
   - Learn to how to incorporate Shopify.
2. Create Post-Plant Teams page layouts/content guide.
   - Figure out the automatic game start finder.
3. Clean up Post-Plant UI.

## Other

One of my ideas for the upcoming hackaton is an automatic notes app using OpenAI's API. We also have some competition as my other friend has his own team so it should be fun.

I also have to start leetcoding and making sure my coding skills / problem solving skills are good before internship interviews.
