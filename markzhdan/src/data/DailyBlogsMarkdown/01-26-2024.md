## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on the eccomerce website and figured out the plan for it. It will be for my sister to sell her clothes and items. I found some cool frontpage design and nextjs templates that will be super helpful and look cool. Initially, I tried to code everything myself but I realized if I "copy" or use code and understand it, I still learn how to use it.

I also started working on predicting hltv's top 20 players of 2024. I have to figure out the metrics and how to quanitfy qualitative variables and apparently I have to use feature engineering.

## Learnings

- Next.js page and layout files.
- Feature engineering.
  - Ordinal encoding, normalization, feature interaction, non-linearity, and regularization.

## Goals

1. Continue working on eccomerce site.
2. Create Post-Plant Teams page layouts/content guide.
   - Figure out the automatic game start finder.
3. Clean up Post-Plant UI.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
<Link
  href="/"
  className="mr-2 flex w-full items-center justify-center md:w-auto lg:mr-6"
>
  <LogoSquare />
  <div className="ml-2 flex-none text-sm font-medium uppercase md:hidden lg:block">
    {SITE_NAME}
  </div>
</Link>
```

Didn't really have any amazing code snippets today but this was a nice way to make a logo/frontpage header for the eccomerce site.
