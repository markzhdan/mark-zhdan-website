## Why?

My goal in 2024 is to code at least once per day. I hope to make a meaningful commit to GitHub each day and I will also be documenting each day with a short blog of my **Coding Summary**, **Learnings**, **Goals**, and a **Cool Code Snippet**.

## Coding Summary

Today, I officially launched Post-Plant! I focused on cleaning up the loose ends and finally hosted it on DigitalOcean.

## Learnings

I learned how to use the app platform on DigitalOcean. It was challenging
to get both the frontend and backend hosted but once I realised you can
make 2 componenets for each app, it was simple to host each one
separately.

## Goals

Goal for tomorrow is to update my website, and start the Buff163 API wrapper.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
const { user, setUser } = useUser();
```

My first custom React hook that gets the user depending on the jwt token!

## Other

Pretty cool tweet from [Suhail](https://x.com/Suhail/status/1741656674396680242?s=20).
I was pretty much in the same position and while I didn't have a specific deadline, I'm glad I got it done for the new year.
Excited for the future of Post-Plant and what I can accomplish with it.
