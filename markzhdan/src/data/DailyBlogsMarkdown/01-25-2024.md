## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on the creating the eccomerce website. Tailwind is becoming easier to learn/use but I still need practice with it. There are some cool designs I wanna do from [this source](https://dribbble.com/shots/5930393-E-commerce-website), and I want to focus on making it fully responsive and dynamic so I have to take my time.

I also helped my friend host his script on Google cloud and then also worked on my data structures project.

## Learnings

- Tailwind class names.

## Goals

1. Create eccomerce site.
   - Learn to how to incorporate Shopify.
2. Create Post-Plant Teams page layouts/content guide.
   - Figure out the automatic game start finder.
3. Clean up Post-Plant UI.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
char rot(char c, int amount) {
   // A-Z | 65-90
   int rotatedChar = (int)c + amount;
   if(rotatedChar > 90){
      rotatedChar = ((rotatedChar - 90) % 27) + 64;
   }

   return (char)rotatedChar;
}
```

Part of my project solution in order to rotate a character by a number for Caesar's cipher.
