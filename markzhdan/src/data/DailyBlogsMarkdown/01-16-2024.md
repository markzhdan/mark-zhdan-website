## Coding Summary

Today, I started work on my second web app which will be an add-on to Post-Plant. Pretty much its a hub for teams so they can have VOD replays, scrim stats and heatmaps. This is where I hope to monetize it. However, I will use a "completely" different tech stack as I hope to use the modern day solution of Next.js, TypeScript, a UI library (shadcn or next-ui) and session based auth. I feel like this is my "dream" tech stack and I was initially going to learn one at a time (TS, then UI libraries) but I feel like learning all these at one time would be easier as they work together and make a seemless product.

## Learnings

- How to use shadcn & next-ui (still debating which one to use).
  - Both missing sidebar components.
- Started TS course @ [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-typescript/lessons/typescript-functions/exercises/introduction).
- Overview of Next.js and what it is.

## Goals

1. Create Post-Plant teams notion overview (PRD, timeline, tech stack).
   - Learn TS & create Nextjs app by tutorial tomorrow.
2. Update TreasuryReport extension.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
};
```

Never used tailwind before. Quite an interesting way to approach CSS/styling as it seems to complicate it. I don't think I'll ever use it but maybe with more exposure and research it could be userful!
