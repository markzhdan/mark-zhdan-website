## Coding Summary

Today, was the first day I did not do much coding. I made a "filler" commit to GitHub to keep my streak but it was a single function in the Buff163 API Wrapper. However, I organized my calendar for my classes and registered for all the books/tools.

## Learnings

- Learned you must work with teams in CS.
- Not all solutions are 100% software, some may require hardware.
  - Would love to see some in depth examples of this!
  - It is important to understand hardware limitations.
- CS Jobs would rather take communication majors because we can't communicate well and they can teach them to code easily.
- _My CS 362 professor is amazing, gets you thinking and is super passionate!_

## Goals

1. Post-Plant replay feature.
2. Adding item functions to Buff163 API.
3. HLTV top 20 players of 2023.
