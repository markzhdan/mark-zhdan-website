## Coding Summary

This morning I worked on my personal website styling and pages. In the evening I worked on updating [Post-Plant](https://postplant.app)'s frontpage. I believe it will make it better for recruiters to see what the website is about. While I copied the styling from scope.gg, it looks really good!

## Learnings

- MUI library is amazing! This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB-sKY63AWo) is tremendous and explained it well!
- It's starting to get harder to find time with school coming up. Hopefully I can keep this up.

## Goals

1. Work on Buff163 API.
2. Apply to internships.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
<Box sx={{ pt: { xs: 1, md: 2 } }}>
  <Typography variant="h4">MUI Example</Typography>
</Box>
```

I love the automatic sizing depending on xs and md. Must start to learn/use MUI!

## Other

I had a proposition to use my data from Post-Plant for a class project/study about performance in groups/teams. Would be super interesting to see the effects and hopefully my data can be helpful!
