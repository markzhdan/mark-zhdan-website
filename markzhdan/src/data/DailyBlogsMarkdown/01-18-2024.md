## Coding Summary

Today, I finsihed the TypeScript course through CodeAcademy. It was a great course that just went over the basics of Typing and how to make code reliable and predictable. I also cleaned up the TreasuryUI extension and made sure to update all the naming configs, folders, and files for each page/view. I plan to use MUI for the ui library so I can learn it. Will be a fun project to fully complete!

## Learnings

- Fully Completed TS Course @ [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-typescript/lessons/typescript-functions/exercises/introduction).
- Learned JS switch statement.

## Goals

1. Figure out TreasuryDirect navigation, page views, links, and how to scrape data.
2. Create Post-Plant teams notion overview (PRD, timeline, tech stack).
   - Learn Next.js by weekend.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
switch (urlParams.get('UIHandler') ) {
  case 'misc.DisplayWelcome':
    console.log("front page");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("not on page");
```

A switch statement in JS. Did not really have any "cool" snippets so this was the most unique code I used today.
