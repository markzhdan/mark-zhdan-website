## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on adding the blog CMS to my personal website (the one you are reading on right now)! I used Netlify GitHub-CMS using Decap which offered a free "backend" to allow me to have an /admin route where I can log on and add blogs. However, the problem is that it still counts as a GitHub commit when I do upload and save a blog. I think going forward I will just make a dedicated backend so I can just design and implement my vision that I have of it now. Maybe I will even convert it to Next.js?!?

## Learnings

- CMS Sytems.
  - GitHub CMS.
  - Decap CMS (Netlify CMS).

## Goals

1. Add backend to personal website.
2. Figure our data flow for Curriculo.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
<script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>
<script>
  if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
    window.netlifyIdentity.on("init", (user) => {
      if (!user) {
        window.netlifyIdentity.on("login", () => {
          document.location.href = "/admin/";
        });
      }
    });
  }
</script>
```

Pretty sick way of integrating a CMS. I literally only had add 2 files (config and index.html) and add a few lines of code to my main index.html and I have an entire way of adding blogs.
