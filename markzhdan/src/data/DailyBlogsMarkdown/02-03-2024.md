## Coding Summary

Today was a chill/break day as I focsued more on planning and my career than actual coding. I planned out some pages of the Curriculo website and just the general layout and how the user would navigate and see their notes/calendar.

I also applied to a few internships. I don't feel that confident anymore but I guess I just have to continue applying and also see if the hackathon has any leads next weekend.

## Learnings

- User website navigation.
- UX/User flow design.

## Goals

1. Add netlify CMS to personal website.
2. Start prototype / first look of Curriculo.
