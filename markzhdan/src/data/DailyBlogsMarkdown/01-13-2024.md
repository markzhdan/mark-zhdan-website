## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on fixing the replay system on Post-Plant and added a VOD selector/adder with a way to set the start time of the game (for calibration). It was mostly trying to understand my previous code and then trying to update it accordingly. However, I tried to rush through it which made my code quite bad with so many divs, css classes and prop drilling.

## Learnings

- "react-youtube" npm package.
- How to post data to database.
  - To update an array you have to completely reset it.

## Goals

1. Learn Next-UI.
2. HLTV Top 20.
3. Brainstorm new website/business.

## Cool Snippet

```javascript
const videoRef = useRef(null);
ref = { videoRef };
```

Refs are used for components to remember/update component information which causing a render.

## Other

I was thinking of making a website template for a government bond/stock website. I have to make a PRD and check if an API exists for the website for the data. Would be a fun project to make with my brother!
