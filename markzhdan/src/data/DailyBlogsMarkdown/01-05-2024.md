## Coding Summary

Today, I worked on reverse engineering the VLR.gg rating ([repo](https://github.com/markzhdan/reverse-eng-vlr-rating)). It was fairly successful but had a decent amount of error compared to what I wanted. However, this was a good project to prepare me for predicting HLTV's top 20 players of 2023 which follows a similar structure.

## Learnings

- Reinforced my knowledge of web scraping with beautiful soup.
- Learned about pandas and sklearn.
  - Have a lot to understand still I just scratched the surface!
  - I want to learn pytorch and all those AI libraries, although I have tried OpenCV for images/videos.

## Goals

1. Work on Buff163 API.
2. Apply to internships.
3. HLTV top 20 players of 2023.
4. Post-Plant replay feature.
5. Update blog so its not a lousy commit to GitHub.
   1. Did explore this with MongoDB's Web SDK to not have a backend but I just have to do more research on it to successfully intergrate it.

## Cool Snippet

```python
headers = [header.text.strip() for header in table.find_all("th")]
```

Simple way to get an array but I just love the "simplicity" of python and its list comprehension.
