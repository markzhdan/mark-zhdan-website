## Coding Summary

Today, I did not get to code much or learn anything new. Kind of bummed out about it as I was bogged down with homework and classes today. However, I did still get to plan out the eccomerce site and kind of explore Next.js a little.

I also wrote some notes down about how React is different from Next.js in my notes and directly compared the features and how they are different in each.

## Learnings

- Sets and maps in C++.

## Goals

1. Create eccomerce site.
   - Learn to how to incorporate Shopify.
2. Create Post-Plant Teams page layouts/content guide.
   - Figure out the automatic game start finder.
3. Clean up Post-Plant UI.

## Cool Snippet

```C++
for(auto character : value){
   if(isalpha(character)){
      cleanWord += character;
   }
}
if(findInVector(uniqueStrings, cleanWord) == -1){
   uniqueStrings.push_back(cleanWord);
   fout << cleanWord << endl;
}
```

Part of my solution to my data structures lab to clean and remove duplicates from a collection of words.
